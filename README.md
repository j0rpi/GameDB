# What is GameDB
GameDB is a personal project of mine which features one single database
for keeping tracks of games I have played. It features a simple yet
sleek design that is appealing to the eye. I was inspired by [TheKotti's](https://www.twitch.tv/thekotti "TheKotti's Twitch Channel") page where he manages the games he has played. 

GameDB also has a rating system, ability to filter by platform/system, and also
a cover art download system, thanks to IGDB.com API. 

GameDB uses PHP and SQLite3. 

# Features
- Search engine
- Ability to add/remove/modify games
- Ability to add/remove/modify categories
- Ability to add/remove/modify platforms/systems
- Rating system
- Platform system
- Administration system
- Speedrun.com / Splits.IO integration (Not yet implemented)

... and more to come i guess.

# Install
Run /install/ and follow the steps. Note that the install script is not finished
at all. You can also just copy the whole repository and run as is. 

Default admin username and password is **admin / admin**

As GameDB uses SQLite3, you must enable this module in your **php.ini**

# Note
Don't run on a public server. No security meassures are implemented :)
